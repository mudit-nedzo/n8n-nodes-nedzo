Subject: Community Node Verification Request - n8n-nodes-nedzo

Dear n8n Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have developed and published a community node for n8n that integrates with Nedzo, an AI voice agent automation platform. I would like to submit it for verification so it can be available to n8n Cloud users.

Package Details:
- npm Package: n8n-nodes-nedzo
- Version: 1.0.0
- npm URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-nedzo
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/mudit-nedzo/n8n-nodes-nedzo
- License: MIT

Node Description:
The Nedzo node enables users to integrate AI-powered voice agents into their n8n workflows. Users can:
- Create and manage AI voice agents
- Initiate automated phone calls
- Configure agent behavior and responses
- Handle voice interactions programmatically
- Automate voice-based customer communications

The node provides operations for:
1. Managing Agents (create, list, get, update, delete)
2. Making Calls (initiate voice calls with AI agents)

Technical Compliance:
✅ Published on npm registry
✅ Package name follows n8n convention (n8n-nodes-nedzo)
✅ Includes 'n8n-community-node-package' keyword
✅ MIT License
✅ No runtime dependencies
✅ All documentation in English
✅ Built using n8n-node CLI tool scaffolding

I am ready to:
- Provide example workflows demonstrating the node's functionality
- Create a demo video showing the node in action
- Submit any additional documentation required
- Make any necessary adjustments to meet verification requirements

Could you please:
1. Confirm the n8n Creator Portal URL (creators.n8n.io) and provide access if needed
2. Guide me through the formal submission process on the Creator Portal
3. Let me know if any additional information or changes are needed to meet verification standards

Additionally, I noticed my n8n Cloud instance (mudit07.app.n8n.cloud) doesn't show the "Install a community node" button in Settings → Community nodes. Could you help enable community node installation for my instance?

I am committed to maintaining this node and providing support to the n8n community.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mudit Kumar
